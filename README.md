## About Dataset

I have drived a sample dataset from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package"> Rain in Australia dataset</a> with limited number of attributes and with changed targeted variable which we are going to predict.

## Spliting Techniques

I have used 3-Flod Cross Validation here and got three trained model in the end. The Evaluation Measure I used is Accuracy and the model with highest accuracy will be good to go to application phase.

## Libararies

I have used following libraries which you need to import before running the code.

- numpy
- pandas
- pickle
- sklearn
- prettytable

## ML Algorithm

The models has been trained in this project using SVC (Support Vector Classifier) Algorithm. You can train it on your desired Algorithm as well. A lot of Classification Algorithms are availabe in sklearn.

## Running Guidlines

It's a simple ipynb file which you can either run in Jupyter notebook or in Google Collab.

## Documentation

I have added 2 pdf files in this repo which contains in detail explanation of the code and the whole Machine Learning Cycle which I have followed in creating this project
